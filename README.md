# File-Access-From-Dropbox
A simple demo project that checks if the user has a Dropbox account, and if he does, then goes to check if he has any .mp3 files. 

## You must run pod install to download the dropbox SDK and similar dependencies. Otherwise, you will not be able to run the projcet, and you will get errors. The pod file has been provided. Just go to your project directory through the terrminal, and run pod install. Make sure you have Cocoa Pods installed.
